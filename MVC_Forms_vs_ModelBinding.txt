Choose an object like a Product, Automobile, Animal, or another of your choosing:
	[ RemoteControlCar ]

Make a view with an HTML form that will allow you to create your object:
	In the controller: create an object and populate it with the form data
	(Hint: Your controller action method should take a IFormCollection object)
	
	RcCar
		carID			int		00001
		make			string	Associated
		model			string	B6.1DL
		motorTurns		number; ie 17.5, 8.5, etc
		esc				string	XR10 Pro G2
		servo			string	RT1709
		batteryCapacity	int		4800
		receiver		string	RX491
		dateAssembled	date	Jan 5, 2020

Make another view that will allow you to create your object but this time use model binding

In both cases, add your object to a database using ADO.NET
	Create a database class with a method to do the insert (we don't want too much code in our controllers)
	This method should be called for both Action Methods (the modelbinding and html form data versions)
	
	// Add object to DB
